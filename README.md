# ModBrowser

A small Minecraft ModBrowser application written in Python and using the CurseForgeAPy package.
It serves as both a recursive mod downloader for mod dependencies, as well as an example application for the CurseForgeAPy package. 

This also serves as a way to learn PyQt5 and its widgets, so I would not recommend using the GUI code as a reference for your own projects.
